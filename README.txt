data-structures-java

This is a library of common data structures that I encountered throughout my Abstract Data Types and Algorithms class that are implemented in Java.

I started this project in my spare time to mainly to practice using the Gradle build system for Java.

This library borrows heavily from the "Open Data Structures" textbook by Pat Morin, which can be found at the URL: http://opendatastructures.org/
